#### What is Broadcast Variables?
Broadcast variables in Apache Spark is a mechanism for sharing variables across executors that are meant to be read-only. Without broadcast variables these variables would be shipped to each executor for every transformation and action, and this can cause network overhead. However, with broadcast variables, they are shipped once to all executors and are cached for future reference.
